id: 2a5b9c6f-91d0-4e62-b8f3-9c6a4e728e4d
status: experimental
description: Detects execution of commands modifying environment variables and files related to shared library hijacking, such as LD_PRELOAD, which is often exploited by malware like Symbiote or auto-color.

            - 'export LD_PRELOAD='  #Sets the LD_PRELOAD variable, which can force the system to load malicious shared libraries before any others
            - 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='  # changing the library search order, which can lead to DLL hijacking.
            - 'echo $LD_PRELOAD'  # Reads the current LD_PRELOAD value, which attackers may do to check if itâ€™s already set
            - 'unset LD_PRELOAD'  #Clears the LD_PRELOAD variable, which can be used by attackers to avoid detection after executing a malicious payload.

  - System administrators modifying library paths for legitimate reasons
  - Certain software installations that update shared library paths
